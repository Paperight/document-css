CSS for document conversions to Paperight PDF

Paperight uses PrinceXML to create print-optimised PDFs for printing at basic photocopy shops. 
We prepare the PDFs in advance as templates that are watermarked per transaction.
These CSS files here are used in our manual document-preparation process when we turn HTML documents into print-optimised PDFs.
